### 🛡️ n8n Workflow Backup Repository

This repo is a dedicated vault for backing up and organizing n8n workflows, ensuring your automation masterpieces are safe, versioned, and ready to deploy. Built for n8n, the open-source automation platform, this repo focuses on preserving your workflows for data syncs, API integrations, and AI-driven tasks.

🎯 Purpose
This repo backs up my personal n8n workflows, including:

- Data Syncs: Automating data transfers between Google Sheets, Airtable, and CRMs like HubSpot.

- API Integrations: Connecting tools like Slack, Trello, and custom APIs for seamless workflows.

- AI Workflows: Using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI) for content generation and data enrichment.

No Python scripts or dependencies are included—pure n8n JSON workflows and documentation.


📂 What's Inside?

/workflows: Stores .json workflow files, named clearly (e.g., sheets_to_hubspot_sync.json, slack_notification.json).

/docs: Markdown files detailing each workflow’s purpose, setup, and credentials needed.
